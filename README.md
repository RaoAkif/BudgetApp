# Budget App

> The Budget App is a mobile web application where you can manage your budget.

This project contains the routes to different views:
- Splash Page
- Home Page (Categories)
- Transactions Page

The `Splash Page` serves as an initial page. From there you can *log in* or *sign up*.

After you successfully log into the app, you will be redirected to the `Home Page`. Here you will have the chance to create categories and view their basic information. From here you can access the `Transactions Page`.

Finally, the `Transactions Page` is where you can see the details from all the transactions you have done for a single category. You can access this page by clicking on the *View transactions* link in the `Home Page`
